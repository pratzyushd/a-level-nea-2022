<h1>TCP/IP Stack Demonstrator</h1>

<text>This website is a demonstrator for the TCP/IP stack concept which is
     taught at both A Level and GCSE in AQA Computer Science. This project
     makes use of a raw socket and makes requests that allow you as the
     user to see a complete transaction that occurs between you and the
     server, alongside explanations and translations of the relevant header
     sections for the specification.</text>
