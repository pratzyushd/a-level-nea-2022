# A Level NEA 2022

Repository hosting the code for my A Level NEA for the 2021-2022 academic year.

This project is intended to be a teaching tool for the TCP/IP stack concept, and
does so by showing the contents of packets and the associated information in
their headers.
This project also has a section dedicated to RSA encryption and the implementation of it to demonstrate to a user (specifically 1024-bit RSA).
